Hence, we have that: \\[\\epsilon = \\left(\\frac{L^2}{GMm^2r} - 1\\right)\\] From here, we square both sides in the hopes that we will get something a lot more helpful: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(\\frac{L^4}{G^2M^2m^4r^2} + 1 - \\frac{2L^2}{GMm^2r}\\right)\\] Welll... that didn't help. Except it did. We note that \\(L^2 = m^2r^2v^2\\) , assuming \\(\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) , hence we are able to substitute in some locations this very value: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(\\frac{L^2m^2r^2v^2}{G^2M^2m^4r^2} + 1 - \\frac{2L^2}{GMm^2r}\\right)\\] Welp. So now we can try eliminating whatever values we can remove, and we get now that: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(\\frac{L^2v^2}{(GMm)^2} + 1 - \\frac{2L^2}{GMm^2r}\\right)\\] To make this better, let's try extracting \\(\\frac{2L^2}{(GMm)^2}\\) from the above expression: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{2L^2}{(GMm)^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}v^2 - \\frac{GM}{r}\\right)\\right)\\] Now, we introduce \\(m\\) into the inner expression: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{2L^2}{(GMm)^2 m} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\right)\\right)\\] And notice that we got the expression for Total Energy, \\(E\\) back! Now we can substitute that in, and get a more decent result: \\[\\epsilon = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm^2)m}}\\] This is a much better way of depicting the eccentricity, \\(\\epsilon\\) . This is also a pretty important result whcih can help us map the trajectory of a particle. Orbit Patterns The Circular Orbit This should ideally be a no-brainer. Circular Orbits are simply orbits with \\(\\epsilon = 0\\) , hence we get the following: \\[\\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} = -1\\] Hence, we can express \\(E\\) as follows: \\[E = \\frac{-(GMm)^2m}{2L^2}\\] We have previously noted the following result too: \\[r = \\frac{L^2}{GMm^2}\\] From here, we get that: \\[E = \\frac{-GMm}{2r}\\] This is in fact a general result, and from here we equate the two definitions of \\(E\\) found: \\[E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r} = K - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\] Moving this around, we get the following result: \\[K = \\frac{GMm}{2r} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\] This can help us get orbital speed, \\(v\\) , at radius \\(r\\) . \\[v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\] This can also help us get the escape velocity, using a parabolic trajectory instead. The Parabolic Orbit In a parabolic trajectory, \\(\\epsilon = 1\\) , which means that \\[\\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} = 0\\] Here, we note that \\(L \\ne 0\\) , since it is physically impossible in any orbit. This means that the total energy, \\(E = 0\\) , which also means the following: \\[K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = G\\frac{Mm}{r}\\] From here, we can represent the new orbital speed, \\(v\\) as: \\[v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\] This is in fact the escape velocity of an orbit, since the object moves to an infinitely far away point after this. This is due to the fact that having \\(E = 0\\) means that there cannot be a bounding effect on the mass anymore. The Elliptical Orbit Alright, so this is the main part of this entire article. We note that \\(\\epsilon\\) does not have a specific value in the case of an elliptical orbit, since \\(\\epsilon\\) follows the following formula, based on the semi-major axis, \\(a\\) and semi-minor axis, \\(b\\) : \\[\\epsilon = \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2}\\] And this ratio, \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) has infinite possibilities. This effectively means that \\(0 \\lt \\epsilon \\lt 1\\) , which opens up a whole range of values. But since we have another representation of \\(\\epsilon\\) , we are able to get a clearer value. Firstly, we note that \\[0 \\lt \\epsilon \\lt 1 \\implies 0 \\lt \\epsilon^2 \\lt 1\\] From here, we have that: \\[0 \\lt 1 + \\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} \\lt 1\\] Since we know that: \\[r = \\frac{L^2}{GMm^2}\\] This means that: \\[-1 \\lt \\frac{2Er}{GMm} \\lt 0\\] Moving along this forumla, we get: \\[-\\frac{GMm}{2r} \\lt E \\lt 0\\] Based on what we have gotten for the the parabolic and circular trajectories, this means that: \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} < v < \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\] One can aslo find the velocity as a function of radial distance for elliptical orbits. This is by acknowledging that \\(E\\) still follows the same description, that is to say that: \\[E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\] We note that due to the concept of a central force, the total energy is conserved about the orbit, hence at any points \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) , \\(E_q = E_r\\) . Considering the locations where the \\(\\vec r\\) and \\(\\vec v\\) vectors are orthogonal to one another, we arrive at the apoapsis and the periapsis, two points located along the major axis of the ellipse. At these locations, we not that \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}2\\) , which means that \\(L = mrv\\) , which is conserved along these two positions. Hence, we have that \\(r_pv_p = r_av_a\\) , where \\(a\\) is the apoapsis and \\(p\\) is the periapsis. From here we have the following: \\[\\frac{1}{2} mv_a^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r_a} = \\frac{1}{2} mv_p^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r_p}\\] Remember that we can remove \\(m\\) , which can help us simplify the expression to this: \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(v_a^2-v_p^2\\right) = GM\\left(\\frac1{r_a}-\\frac1{r_p}\\right)\\] Yeah, that is helpful. Anyways, we go on to introduce the representation we previously restablised, in a slightly different light: \\[v_a^2 = 2GM \\frac{r_p-r_a}{r_ar_p}\\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{r_a^2}{r_p^2}\\right)}=2GM \\frac{r_p}{r_a(r_a+r_p)}\\] Luckily for us, we know that \\(r_a+r_p=2a\\) , so we can use that to our disposal: \\[v_a^2 = GM \\frac{2a-r_a}{ar_a} = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right)\\] From here, we can get a general expression for the \"specific energy\", as shown below: \\[\\frac{2E}{m} = v^2 - \\frac{2GM}{r} = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{2a} \\right) - \\frac{2GM}{r_a} = -\\frac{GM}{a}\\] Expressing \\(v^2\\) in terms of the relevant quantities, we get the following famous equation: \\[v^2 = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\] This is the vis-viva equation, commonly used to describe the velocity of an object in elliptical motion. This formula can be used for many tasks, like computing velocity in an elliptical orbit and more. The point is that it is quite ingenious but also just as torturous. Hence, use it with care.","title":"The Trajectory of a Particle in Orbit"},{"location":"orbital/mechanics/trajectory_of_particle/#the-trajectory-of-a-particle-in-orbit","text":"We note that the gravitational force, \\(\\vec F_g\\) is still defined as below: \\[\\vec F_g = - G \\frac{Mm}{r^2} \\hat r\\] From here, since we note that \\(\\vec F_{net} = \\vec F_g\\) , we have the following expression: \\[\\vec F_g = - G \\frac{Mm}{r^2} \\hat r = m\\vec a\\] From here we can derive the centripetal acceleration at any point, \\(\\vec a\\) : \\[\\vec a = - G \\frac{M}{r^2} \\hat r\\] Since we have this expression, we can now introduce \\(\\vec L\\) to these expressions: \\[\\vec a \\times \\vec L = - G \\frac{M}{r^2} \\hat r \\times \\vec L\\] From here, we have one important observation to note, that being as follows: \\[\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\vec v \\times \\vec L\\right) = \\dot{\\vec{v}} \\times \\vec L + \\vec v \\times \\dot{\\vec{L}} = \\vec a \\times \\vec L\\] and since we have the following: \\[\\begin{align*}\\vec a \\times \\left(\\vec b \\times \\vec c \\right) &= \\begin{pmatrix}a_x \\\\ a_y \\\\ a_z \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\left(\\begin{pmatrix}b_x \\\\ b_y \\\\ b_z \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix}c_x \\\\ c_y \\\\ c_z \\end{pmatrix} \\right)\\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}a_x \\\\ a_y \\\\ a_z \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix}b_yc_z - b_z c_y \\\\ b_zc_x - b_xc_z \\\\ b_xc_y - b_yc_x \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}a_y(b_xc_y - b_yc_x) - a_z(b_zc_x - b_xc_z) \\\\ a_z(b_yc_z - b_z c_y) - a_x(b_xc_y - b_yc_x) \\\\ a_x(b_zc_x - b_xc_z) - a_y(b_yc_z - b_z c_y) \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}(a_yc_y + a_zc_z)b_x - (a_yb_y + a_zb_z)c_x \\\\ (a_xc_x + a_zc_z)b_y - (a_xb_x + a_zb_z)c_y \\\\ (a_xc_x + a_yc_y)b_z - (a_xb_x + a_yb_y)c_z\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}(a_xc_x + a_yc_y + a_zc_z)b_x - (a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z)c_x \\\\ (a_xc_x + a_yc_y a_zc_z)b_y - (a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z)c_y \\\\ (a_xc_x + a_yc_y + a_zc_z)b_z - (a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z)c_z\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}(\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)b_x - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b)c_x \\\\ (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)b_y - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b)c_y \\\\ (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)b_z - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b)c_z\\end{pmatrix}\\\\&=(\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)\\vec b - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b) \\vec c\\end{align*}\\] We get the following as well: \\[\\begin{align*}- G \\frac{M}{r^2} \\hat r \\times \\vec L &= - G \\frac{Mm}{r^3} \\vec r \\times (\\vec r \\times \\vec v) \\\\ &= \\frac{-GMm}{r^3} \\left[ (\\vec r \\cdot \\vec v) \\vec r -(r^2)\\vec v\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{GMm}{r^3} \\left[(r^2)\\vec v - (rv) \\vec r\\right]\\end{align*}\\] We now observe something else as well: \\[\\begin{align*}\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{GMm}{r} \\vec r \\right) &= GMm \\frac{\\vec v r - \\vec r v}{r^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{GMm}{r^3} \\left[\\vec v (r^2) - \\vec r (vr) \\right]\\end{align*}\\] From here, we are able to determine the following equality: \\[\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\vec v \\times \\vec L\\right) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{GMm}{r} \\vec r \\right)\\] Which also yields the following result: \\[\\vec v \\times \\vec L = \\frac{GMm}{r} \\vec r + GMm \\vec C\\] Wherein \\(GMm\\vec{C}\\) is a constant vector of integration that lies in the plane of motion of \\(m\\) .

Anyways, we go on to introduce the representation we previously restablised, in a slightly different light: \\[v_a^2 = 2GM \\frac{r_p-r_a}{r_ar_p}\\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{r_a^2}{r_p^2}\\right)}=2GM \\frac{r_p}{r_a(r_a+r_p)}\\] Luckily for us, we know that \\(r_a+r_p=2a\\) , so we can use that to our disposal: \\[v_a^2 = GM \\frac{2a-r_a}{ar_a} = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right)\\] From here, we can get a general expression for the \"specific energy\", as shown below: \\[\\frac{2E}{m} = v^2 - \\frac{2GM}{r} = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{2a} \\right) - \\frac{2GM}{r_a} = -\\frac{GM}{a}\\] Expressing \\(v^2\\) in terms of the relevant quantities, we get the following famous equation: \\[v^2 = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\] This is the vis-viva equation, commonly used to describe the velocity of an object in elliptical motion. This formula can be used for many tasks, like computing velocity in an elliptical orbit and more. The point is that it is quite ingenious but also just as torturous. Hence, use it with care.","title":"The Elliptical Orbit"},{"location":"practical/","text":"Astronomy Practicals We hold practical sessions every Friday from 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm.

In nuclear fusion, nuclei are fused together to form heavier elements, generating energy in the process. The amount of energy released in nuclear fusion is much greater than that of chemical burning or gravitational collapse, giving the Sun\u2019s lifetime of around 10 billion years. There are three main types of nuclear fusion that occur in stars. Depending on the mass of the star, different types of fusion will be dominant in the core of the star. Proton-Proton Chain The first is the proton-proton (PP) chain, which fuses hydrogen into helium. This reaction begins at around 6 million K and usually occurs in stars of one solar mass or below. It is the primary energy source of our Sun. There are other rarer reaction pathways that involve the heavier elements, but for clarity\u2019s sake, below is the one that converts hydrogen directly into helium. Keeping in mind that hydrogen and other elements in stars exist as plasma rather than atoms, the fusion of hydrogen will involve fusing 2 protons (nuclei of hydrogen) together. Considering the immense repulsion (also known as the Coulomb barrier between like charges at such small distances, it seems impossible that fusion can even occur. In fact, it was initially calculated that temperatures in the sun were a thousand times too low for protons to have enough energy to overcome this barrier. However, it is clear that the sun must be capable of fusing hydrogen, since we are all not dead. To explain this very apparent discrepancy, we shall turn to quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, every particle has both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. This leads to the Heisenburg Uncertainity Principle, which states that a limit to which we can be sure of a particle's position and momentum. Thus, particles can \"tunnel\" through potential barriers, allowing them to exist in places classically impermissible. Thus, a very minute number of protons will actually \"tunnel\" through the Coulomb barrier and react with each other. Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) Cycle This cycle involves elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, and is dominant in stars slightly heavier than the sun at around 1.3 solar masses. Of course, this PP chain still operates alongside this cycle in the star, but the CNO cycle is relatively faster. As you can see, the carbon-12 nucleus is regenerated, and four hydrogen atoms are indirectly converted into helium at the end. This means that the carbon-12 nucleus is in fact a catalyst. Triple Alpha Process The triple alpha process requires alot of energy and thus, occurs largely in higher mass stars and red giants. You can see why. Here we combine 3 helium-4 nuclei to form a carbon-12 nucleus, releasing energy in the process. The repulsion and thus the Coulomb barrier, is stronger because we are effectively fusing helium which has a higher charge. The temperature needs to be much higher to supply enough energy for this reaction to take place fast enough. Energy Production In nuclear physics, the mass of atoms are given in atomic mass units (or u for short). The carbon-12 atom is defined to be exactly 12 u in mass, and so a hydrogen atom, or one proton, is around \\(1 u\\) in mass. A proton by itself (i.e. a hydrogen nucleus) actually has a mass of \\(1.007276466812 u\\) , for reasons that you will see. In the PP chain, where four hydrogen nuclei (protons) are converted into one helium nucleus (2 proton, 2 neutrons), the sum of masses of the four protons is 0.7% larger than the mass of one helium nucleus. This mass defect is actually converted to energy according to \\(E = m c^2\\) in the PP chain. This energy is also known as the binding energy, which comes from the strong nuclear force holding the nuclei together.

This means that at the centre of the star there is a great pressure since there is more stuff compressing the core. As we all know, more pressure means that things get hotter. Thus, it is at the core, where the temperature of the star is the highest. Now, we all know that nuclear fusion needs a high temperature to occur. After all, why would scientists want cold fusion if it happened at room temperature? Given the core has the highest temperature in the entire star, it is logical that it is the location where nuclear fusion occurs. Now that we know how energy in the star is made. How is it produced? Let us find out. Note The subsequent analysis of the radiative zone and convective zone is done with respect to a sun-like star. Depending on the mass of the star, the radiative zone can be the inside or outside layer of the star. The Radiative Zone On its journey out, energy in the form of photons first enters the radiative zone. As the name suggests, radiation is the main form of energy transfer here \u2013 though not quite the form that you would expect! Keeping in mind that the stars are very dense, photons don\u2019t travel straight through. Rather, they travel in a zigzag manner. This zigzag motion is caused by the photons \"bouncing\" around within this dense layer. Note that this layer of plasma is so hot that it is fully ionized (all electrons are stripped from atoms to form nuclei), so the constituent particles interact strongly with light. Overall, due to the sheer density of the radiative zone, a photon takes a few million years to reach the edge of the radiative zone from the core. This is in spite of the fact that photons travel at the speed of light. This bouncing also gradually causes the photon to lose energy over time, and its wavelength will decrease, causing it to fall from the gamma range to the visible-UV range in the electromagnetic spectrum. Conditions for Energy Transfer via Radiation Energy transfer by radiation occurs when there is a low temperature gradient and low enough opacity to allow energy transfer by radiation. It also requires a high temperature as the hydrogen atoms need to be ionised for the star to be transparent to ultraviolet radiation. The Convective Zone At this point, temperatures are sufficiently low for electrons and atomic nuclei to recombine and form atoms. These atoms will then absorb the photons and heat up. Thus, the plasma at the bottom of the convective zone is hotter and less dense. As a result, it rises while the cooler plasma (which is denser) sinks. This setups up convection currents which are visible to the naked eye (see the picture of convection cells on the sun's surface). When the plasma reaches the surface of the star, its energy is released as heat. Conditions for Energy Transfer via Convection Energy transfer by convection occurs when there is a large temperature gradient a given parcel of gas within the star will continue to rise if it rises slightly via an adiabatic process. Different Mass Stars Different mass stars have different orders of layers (see above). Click on the tabs below to see why. \\(M\\) < \\(0.5 M_\\odot\\) \\(0.5 M_\\odot\\) < \\(M\\) < \\(1.5 M_\\odot\\) \\(M\\) > \\(1.5 M_\\odot\\) Stars with masses less than 0.5 solar masses do not have a radiative zone and only have a convective zone. This is because the temperature in these low mass stars is low enough such that the hydrogen is largely neutral and thus opaque to UV photons. Thus, energy transfer is dominated by convection. Stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.5 solar masses have a radiative zone on the inside and a convective zone on the outside. In these stars, hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via proton\u2013proton chains, which do not establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the inner portion of solar mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star. Stars with masses above 1.5 solar masses have a convective zone on the inside and a radiative zone on the outside. In these stars, the core temperature much higher, so hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via the CNO cycle. Due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the CNO cycle, the temperature gradient in the inner portion of the star is steep enough to make the core convective. In the outer portion of the star, the temperature gradient is shallower but the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized, so the star remains transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Thus, massive stars have a radiative envelope.","title":"Structure of a Star"},{"location":"stellar/basics/star_structure/#structure-of-a-star","text":"","title":"Structure of a Star"},{"location":"stellar/basics/star_structure/#the-core","text":"Recall that a star is constantly under pressure due to gravity compressing it.

Conditions for Energy Transfer via Convection Energy transfer by convection occurs when there is a large temperature gradient a given parcel of gas within the star will continue to rise if it rises slightly via an adiabatic process.","title":"The Convective Zone"},{"location":"stellar/basics/star_structure/#different-mass-stars","text":"Different mass stars have different orders of layers (see above).

This is because the temperature in these low mass stars is low enough such that the hydrogen is largely neutral and thus opaque to UV photons. Thus, energy transfer is dominated by convection. Stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.5 solar masses have a radiative zone on the inside and a convective zone on the outside. In these stars, hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via proton\u2013proton chains, which do not establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the inner portion of solar mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star. Stars with masses above 1.5 solar masses have a convective zone on the inside and a radiative zone on the outside. In these stars, the core temperature much higher, so hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via the CNO cycle. Due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the CNO cycle, the temperature gradient in the inner portion of the star is steep enough to make the core convective. In the outer portion of the star, the temperature gradient is shallower but the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized, so the star remains transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Thus, massive stars have a radiative envelope.","title":"Different Mass Stars"},{"location":"stellar/classification/classification/","text":"Classification of Stars Not all stars are like our sun (if you need a reminder).

Orange - subgiant branch The outer envelope is so extended that it is only weakly held by gravitational force to the rest of the star and easily ejected. However the contracted helium core is incredibly dense. It is only about one-third its original size. The core contraction and envelope expansion is very rapid, taking only a few million years. In this time the temperature of the star will cool from its main sequence value of 6,000\u201330,000 K to around 5,000 K. Hence there are very few stars in that area in the HR diagram hertzsprung gap Hydrogen fusion in the shell produces more helium. This gets dumped onto the core, adding to its mass, causing it to heat up even more. When the core temperature reaches 100 million K , the helium nuclei now have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the strong coulombic repulsion and fuse together, forming carbon-12 in a two-stage process.

Carbon and oxygen nuclei have more protons in them than helium does so the repulsion is greater, and require higher temperature and pressure.

Stars less than 8 times the mass of our sun can't reach those temperatures and densities. The core contraction does however generate sufficient heat for the surrounding layer of helium to start fusing, that is helium shell burning starts.

Planets and especially Stars (hence why this chapter is in the Stellar Evolution Notes) are often compared using the Magnitude scales. According to ancient astronomers, especially the Chinese astronomers back in the day, brightness was in fact proportional to size, which meant that a brighter star would be way larger in a geocentric model than a smaller star.

In ancient Greece, around the time a simple handyman named Jesus started preaching about a different god than those the pagans believed, an ancient astronomer by the name of Hipparchus decided to try classifying every star in the sky into 6 relevant categories. He decided to go with the following demarkation: The Brightest, most luminous stars were the \"Stars of the First Magnitude\" The Unclear, those barely visible to the naked eye, stars were the \"Stars of the Sixth Magnitude\" However the problem that rose from this system was that it was highly arbitrary and subjective, since Hipparchus did all the measurements by himself without consulting for help. Pogson Norman Pogson was an astrophysicist at the prestigious Oxford University back in 1856 when he came with a solution to the magnitude scaling problem. He proferred a solution that used a logarithmic scale rather than a linear scale. Since detectors were actually present back then, Pogson was able to come to a unique scale system: each factor of difference in magnitude denoted \\(100^{\\frac{1}{5}} \\approx 2.512\\) as a change of luminosity. That is to say, a star of magnitude +4.00 was \\(2.512\\) times as bright as a star of magnitude +5.00, or rather, a star of magnitude +0.00 was a 100 times a bright that of magnitude +5.00. At that point Polaris was used a reference point, since it had a good old nice value of \\(m = +2.00\\) . However, a few years later, it was discovered that Polaris is a variable star. That meant that it's magnitude was not a constant, and it changed at some points. After this, the astronomical community decided to use Vega as a reference point, since it had a nice magnitude of \\(m = +0.00\\) , or after a few minor corrections, \\(m = +0.026\\) . This came to a head when, in recent years, Vega was also found to be variable. However the astronomical community has yet to decide what object they want to use next. Apparent Magnitudes of Common Objects Using this method, we have been able to standardize the following variables for easy reference: Object Magnitude \\(m_{sun} = m_\\bigodot\\) -26.7 (VERY LOW) \\(m_{moon}\\) (when brightest) -12.9 (Quite Low) \\(m_{venus}\\) (when brightest) -4.9 \\(m_{sirius}\\) (brightest star) -1.5 \\(m_{vega}\\) (reference point) +0.0 \\(m_{min}\\) (faintest star visible to the naked eye +6.0 Pogson's Law Pogson's Law is used to compare between two different objects in the night sky. We use a logarithmic scale of base 10, or 2.512. The equation is as follows: \\[\\frac{F_1}{F_2} = 10^{\\frac{2}{5} \\left(m_2 - m_1 \\right)}\\] For instance, this law is applicable in calculations such as comparing the brightness of the sun and the moon. Since we know that the Sun's Apparent Magnitude is -26.7, and the Full Moon's Apparent Magnitude is -12.9, we can apply it to the formula below: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{F_\\bigodot}{F_{moon}} &= 10^{\\frac{2}{5} \\left(-12.9 - (-26.7) \\right)} \\\\ &= 10^{\\frac{2}{5}\\left(13.8\\right)} \\\\ &\\approx 10^6 = 1 000 000 \\end{align*}\\] By this, we note that the sun is a million times brighter than the moon in the Earth sky. Absolute Magnitude One thing to note is that we don't know if a sky in the night sky is dim simply because it's dim or because it's too far away to be visible. Hence, many decided to build on Pogson's \"apparent\" magnitude system with a new conception known to man as the Absolute Magnitude .
