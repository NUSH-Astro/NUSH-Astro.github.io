## Eyepieces
Generally, you want to use wide angle eyepieces, such as the 32mm, 25mm, or in the case of the Lightbridge or Vixen, the 26mm. This maximises the effective field of view obtained with each scope.

Once you have centered an object in the scope, and want to get a closer look at it (maybe it's a planet, or maybe you're insane), you can swap out the wide angle eyepiece for one with a shorter focal length, e.g. the 17mm, 10mm, or god forbid, the **4mm**. This will provide you with a larger magnification, but reduce image quality and brightness.

## Diagonals
Diagonals serve to allow a easier time taking in a look through scopes when they are pointed at celestial objects close to the zenith. The reflecting diagonals we have invert the image, resulting in a net upright view of the sky. However, this causes a lateral inversion of the image, hence it is something to be taken note of when comparing to star charts.

A diagonal is mandatory to allow the William Optics refractor to focus.

## Adaptors and T-Rings
Adaptors are useful to speed up the rate of microevolution in the eyepieces, and allow them to attach themselves to telescopes that are larger or smaller that themselves, while T-Rings serve as the intermolecular force between a camera's lens and the optics of a telescope, allowing them to maintain a rigid structure and a fixed volume.
