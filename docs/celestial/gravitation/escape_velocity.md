# Escape speed

The escape speed of an object within a planet's gravitation field is the **minimum** speed it requires to reach a location where it is free from the planet's gravitational pull. To achieve this, the object must have enough kinetic energy to move infinitely far away from the planet.

Suppose an object of mass $m$ is projected from the Earth's surface with an initial speed $v$. 

$$U_\infty=0$$

$$U_{planet}=-\frac{GMm}{R}$$

Applying conservation of energy:

$$\frac{1}{2} m v^2 -\frac{GMm}{R}=0$$

where $R$ is the radius of the planeta dn $M$ is the mass of the planet. 

Hence, escape speed is:

$$v=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$
