# Getting Started

Welcome to the orbital mechanics section! Yes this section truly needs an introduction of its own.

We are finally ready to move on to the _real_ celestial mechanics. Yes, everything until now was just laying the foundation (what you will learn in year 4 core physics). It is here we will be taking a glimpse at the jargon and the real (not too oversimplified) kinds of systems that celestial mechanicians deal with.

!!! Danger

    This entire section is a WIP as of now
