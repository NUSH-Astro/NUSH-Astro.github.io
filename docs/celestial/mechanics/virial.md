# Virial Theorem

As you may know by now, solving things analytically with forces is great, as long as we keep the number of bodies below 2. As you many _also_ know, astronomers panic with just 3 bodies.

There is also the fact that the universe isn't made of 2-body systems. So, what do we do? It helps to get just a general "overview" of sorts on the system, rather than look into the specific forces and the motion they cause. A great tool for this is the virial theorem.

## The Equation

$$\langle T \rangle = - \frac{1}{2} \langle U \rangle$$

where T and U are the kinetic and gravitational potential energies respectively. 

The equation applies to a system of discrete particles, bound by potential forces (in astronomy, GPE).

The $\langle \rangle$ operators represent time averaged values.
