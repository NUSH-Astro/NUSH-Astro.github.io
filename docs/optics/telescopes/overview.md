# Overview

There are **many** different types of telescopes, but the ones we will we focus on (because its the only one that actually matters a lot in astronomy) is optical telescopes. 

Even then there are many varieties.

!!! Quote "Fundamental principle of all optical telescopes"

    Light tends to spread over an area as we move further away. So, if we can collect the light over a big area, and then concentrate it back, we can see a fainter object. That device is called a telescope.

Telescopes can make use of lenses, mirrors, or a combination of both.

The main types our astronomy club has is:

- Refractor
- Reflector
- Catadioptric

All telescopes we use, fall under one of these categeories.
