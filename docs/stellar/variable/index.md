# Introduction

What is a variable star? As the name suggests it is a star that periodically changes its apparent / actual brightness. 
There are 2 types of variable stars.

- Intrinsic variables, whose luminosity actually changes; for example, because the star periodically swells and shrinks.
- Extrinsic variables, whose apparent changes in brightness are due to changes in the amount of their light that can reach Earth; for example, because the star has an orbiting companion that sometimes eclipses it.

Many, possibly most, stars have at least some variation in luminosity: the energy output of our Sun, for example, 
varies by about 0.1% over an 11-year solar cycle.

In this section, we will go through the physics and types of variable stars as well as how we detect them using light curves and whatnot.

## Types of Variable Stars

### Intrinstic Variables
- **Pulsating Variable Stars**: There are many different types of pulsating variable stars. Some of them vary in brightness by as much as 100 times, and some have cycles that repeat as often as every few days, while others vary over months or years. In most cases these stars pulsate because they are at the end of their lives and have become unstable.
    - Cepheid Variables
    - RR Lyrae
    - Delta Scuti
- **Eruptive Variable Stars**: These stars are more likely to have very irregular cycles. The variations in brightness are due to eruption of material from the surface, hence leading to the name "eruptive".  
    - [Protostars](../evolution/the_beginning.md#the-protostar)
    - Giants and supergiants shed material easily due to their large size and unstable nature
    - White dwarfs part of a binary system may also experience eruptions when they draw material from their partner stars

### Extrinsic Variables
- **Eclipising Stars**: Stars with sizeable sunspots may show significant variations in brightness as they rotate, and brighter areas of the surface are brought into view. Bright spots also occur at the magnetic poles of magnetic stars. Stars with ellipsoidal shapes may also show changes in brightness as they present varying areas of their surfaces to the observer.
- **Rotating Stars**: In binary systems, when seen from certain angles, one star may eclipse the other, causing a reduction in brightness.
