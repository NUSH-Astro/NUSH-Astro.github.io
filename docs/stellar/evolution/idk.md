> Evolutionary tracks of stars with masses in the range $M_\bigodot \leq M \leq 9M_\bigodot$ during hydrogen burning, i.e. from hydrogen ignition on the main sequence – the **z**ero-**a**ge **m**ain **s**equence or ZAMS – to helium ignition on the red-giant branch. The slow evolution from ZAMS to line A is due to small structural changes during core hydrogen burning. The zigzag in stars with $M \geq 2M_\bigodot$ marks (first, along line A, the cooler turning point) the contraction of the core as gravitational energy release dominates hydrogen burning, and (second, along line B, the hotter turning point) the transition to shell-hydrogen burning. A $15M_\bigodot$ star is also shown; this ignites helium (point marked ‘He’) while still close to the main sequence.

> Helium-burning evolutionary tracks, following on from the hydrogen-burning phase shown in above figure. The cyan (red if light mode) lines show the hydrogen-burning phase, and the orange (blue if light mode) lines show the helium-burning phase.

> In stars with $M\leq2.5M_\bigodot$, helium is ignited in a degenerate core, and the star moves back down from the top of its red-giant track to the red-giant clump halfway up the track (hollow circle).

> In stars with $2.5M_\bigodot \leq M \leq 9M_\bigodot$, the core is not degenerate when helium ignites, and these stars move blueward (i.e. to the left) in the H–R diagram, but move redward again (i.e. to the right) once core-helium burning is replaced by shell-helium burning. This path is called a _blue loop_.

> In stars with $M>9M_\bigodot$, helium ignites when the star is still close to the main sequence and does not interrupt its redward evolution.
