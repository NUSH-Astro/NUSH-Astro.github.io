# Evolution of low-mass stars

The most boring kind of star. But also the simplest. And they make up 70% of all stars in the universe. 
And they last a long time. Note that there is no radiative zone, it is fully _convective_. 
So _all_ of its hydrogen can be fused before running out.

They fuse hydrogen into helium using the PP chain at 10-12 million K, for nearly a **trillion** years.
