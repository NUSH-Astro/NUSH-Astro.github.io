# Classification of Stars

Not all stars are like our sun (if you need a reminder). Thus, we need to organise them into classes. Now, we will see
how this has been done.

## Spectral Class

A spectral class is a letter denoting the star’s ionisation state. In simple terms, it just 
means how hot the star’s surface temperature is. In order of decreasing surface temperature,
there are the O, B, A, F, G, K and M classes for the Morgan-Keenan System of classification.
Most stars are classified under this system. O and B represent the bluest, hottest stars, A
and F represent the white stars, G yellow, K orange and M red. 

A commonly used mnemonic to remember this is: "**O**h, **B**e A **F**ine Girl, **K**iss **M**e". 
But since Singapore’s education system is an extremely demanding, rigourous and competitve one as compared to other countries’, 
for most Singaporean I'm sure that this is far more memorable: "**O**h **B**oy, **A**n **F** **G**rade 
**K**ills **M**e".

The system can be extended to include other stars. W is a spectral class that comes
before O and describes Wolf-Rayet stars, which are extremely hot and bluish, sometimes
characterised by luminosities so intense that outer layers are occasionally blown away by its
own stellar wind.

After M we can insert even more spectral classes for cooler stars. These stars are
generally failed stars that we call brown dwarves, stars that don’t have enough energy to
start nuclear fusion in their cores.

In order of decreasing temperature, there are the L, T and Y brown dwarf stars. Y class brown dwarves in particular 
are ultra-cool, with surface temperatures going down to below 600 K. These will be discussed further in the section on
stellar evolution.
