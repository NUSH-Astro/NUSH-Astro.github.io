# Stefan-Boltzmann Law

The idea of luminosity came about to allow astronomers to quantify the total output of radiation. In simple terms, luminosity is the rate of energy released by a star or an object. It turns out that for blackbodies there is a relation called the Stefan-Boltzmann law which allows
us to calculate the luminosity.

$$
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
$$

where R is the radius of the star, $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann Constant and T is the temperature of the star's surface.

To find the brightness / intensity of the star some distance away from it, we can use

$$
b = \frac{L}{4 \pi D^2}
$$

where D is the distance from the star.

This follows the inverse square law of light intensity as it goes further away from its source. Notice how the brightness is expressed as a flux, that is, the rate of energy output per unit area (in this case, the area is the area of the sphere with radius equal to the distance between the observer and the source since light from an object spreads out in all directions i.e. in a spherically symmetrical manner).
