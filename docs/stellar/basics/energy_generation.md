# Energy Generation

Nuclear fusion was discovered as the source of energy for the Sun as well as other
stars by Hans Bethe in the 1930s, who worked out the steps for the different kinds of nuclear
fusion present in stars. In nuclear fusion, nuclei are fused together to form heavier elements,
generating energy in the process. The amount of energy released in nuclear fusion is much
greater than that of chemical burning or gravitational collapse, giving the Sun’s lifetime of
around 10 billion years.

There are three main types of nuclear fusion that occur in stars. Depending on the
mass of the star, different types of fusion will be dominant in the core of the star.

## Proton-Proton Chain

The first is the proton-proton (PP) chain, which fuses hydrogen into helium. This
reaction begins at around 6 million K and usually occurs in stars of one solar mass or below.
It is the primary energy source of our Sun. There are other rarer reaction pathways that involve
the heavier elements, but for clarity’s sake, below is the one that converts hydrogen directly
into helium.

Keeping in mind that hydrogen and other elements in stars exist as plasma rather than
atoms, the fusion of hydrogen will involve fusing 2 protons (nuclei of hydrogen) together.
Considering the immense repulsion (also known as the Coulomb barrier between like
charges at such small distances, it seems impossible that fusion can even occur. In fact, it
was initially calculated that temperatures in the sun were a thousand times too low for protons
to have enough energy to overcome this barrier.

However, it is clear that the sun must be capable of fusing hydrogen, since we are all not dead.
To explain this very apparent discrepancy, we shall turn to quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, every particle has 
both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. This leads to the Heisenburg Uncertainity Principle, which states that 
a limit to which we can be sure of a particle's position and momentum. Thus, particles can "tunnel" through potential
barriers, allowing them to exist in places classically impermissible. Thus, a very minute
number of protons will actually "tunnel" through the Coulomb barrier and react with each other.

## Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) Cycle

This cycle involves elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, and is dominant in stars slightly heavier than the sun at 
around 1.3 solar masses. Of course, this PP chain still operates alongside this cycle in the star, but the
CNO cycle is relatively faster. As you can see, the carbon-12 nucleus is regenerated, and four hydrogen atoms are 
indirectly converted into helium at the end. This means that the carbon-12 nucleus is in fact a catalyst.

## Triple Alpha Process

![triple_alpha.svg](../assets/triple_alpha_dark.svg#only-dark)

The triple alpha process requires alot of energy and thus, occurs largely in higher mass stars and red giants. 
You can see why. Here we combine 3 helium-4 nuclei to form a carbon-12 nucleus, releasing energy in the process. 
The repulsion and thus the Coulomb barrier, is stronger because we are effectively fusing helium which has a higher 
charge. The temperature needs to be much higher to supply enough energy for this reaction to take place fast enough.

## Energy Production

In nuclear physics, the mass of atoms are given in atomic mass units (or u for short).
The carbon-12 atom is defined to be exactly 12 u in mass, and so a hydrogen atom, or one proton, is around 
$1 u$ in mass. A proton by itself (i.e. a hydrogen nucleus) actually has a mass of $1.007276466812 u$, 
for reasons that you will see. 

In the PP chain, where four hydrogen nuclei (protons) are converted into one helium nucleus (2 proton, 
2 neutrons), the sum of masses of the four protons is 0.7% larger than the mass of one helium nucleus. This **mass defect** 
is actually converted to energy according to $E = m c^2$ in the PP chain. This energy is also known as the 
binding energy, which comes from the strong nuclear force holding the nuclei together.

To understand how something can weigh less than the sum of its parts, the video below by PBS Space Time is recommended.

> Logarithm of the relative energy output ($\varepsilon$) of proton–proton (PP), CNO and Triple-α fusion processes at different temperatures (T). The dashed line shows the combined energy generation of the PP and CNO processes within a star. At the Sun's core temperature of 15.5 million K the PP process is dominant. The PPI process and the CNO process are equal at around 20 million
