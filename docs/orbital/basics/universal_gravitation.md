# Universal Gravitation

Universal Gravitation is likely the most basic principle you will learn in Gravitation, which, in hindsight, is rather depressing, to say the least. It is based on the following equation, which has cemented itself as one of the most iconic ever in recent years.

!!! note "What"
    I have no idea what the above paragraph means but anyways the formula below is very important

$$F_g = G \frac{Mm}{r^2}$$

Let's first get into the definitions of each of the variables in this equations.

## The Gravitational Constant, $G$

The Gravitational Constant is pretty much just a constant that scientists measured empirically, that has really no relevance to the solution. The only reason it exists is for calculation, and the value we use isn't necessarily accurate.

Empirically determined, $G$ is defined as follows:

$$G = 6.6743015 \times 10^{-14} \frac{m^3}{kg \cdot s^2}$$

Yes, the units are indeed as cancerous as they seem. We usally use a rounded down value of $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-14}$ in normal mathematical calculations, since beyond this term, the values approach redundancy due to Significant Figure and Negligibility considerations.

## The Masses of the Objects, $M$ and $m$

!!! note "Note: Don't waste your time"
    this entire section can summarized as $M$ is an object with bigger mass than $m$

Gravitational Force is dependent of mass, or in this case, the two masses interacting.

Picture two objects that are next to each other

Those 2 masses experience the same $F_g$, towards each other.

$M$ is usually for describing much bigger mass than $m$ such that only the force on $m$ actually matters.

Often, we use $M_S$ or $M_\odot$ to represent the Mass of the Sun, or the _Solar Mass_.
We also use $M_E$ or $M_\bigoplus$ to represent the Mass of the Earth.

The following is a list of the variables we use for masses, which are usually represented with $M$ since they are traditionally huge masses.

| Property                              | Value                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Mass of the Sun, $M_S$ or $M_\odot$   | $1.989 \times 10^{30}$                             |
| Mass of Earth, $M_E$ or $M_\bigoplus$ | $5.972 \times 10^{24} \approx 5.97 \times 10^{24}$ |
| Mass of Moon, $M_{moon}$              | $7.348 \times 10^{22}$                             |

!!! Note "Note: You don't actually need to memorize these"
    There _should_ be a constant sheet given

## The distance between the objects, $r$

r is the distance between the objects. From the formula you can see that if the distance halves, the force increases by 4. This is the inverse square law, which is useful to know intuitively.
